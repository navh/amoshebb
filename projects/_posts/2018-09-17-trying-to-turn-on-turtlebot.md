# TurtleBot

## On-Board Laptop

We have learned that it is possible to launch ROS on the laptop that the poor old TurtleBot lugs around with it everywhere. 

Sadly though it gets confused with its own IP addresses and is unable to fire itself up. Hopefully we can get it running before Thursday's next thesis lab period.

## Off-Board Laptop

The second laptop has been acquired and we are now able to run simulations and install our own versions of ROS and OpenCV.
