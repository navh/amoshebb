This should be a link to a printable copy of my CV, but given that I havenâ€™t uploaded that yet, for now it is just a reminder to myself to get that done.



# Timeline

## HSBC

##### Analyst - Data Science and Engineering

This is my first real gig, so far all I know is I should be going to London to meet a bunch of other fresh HSBC faces!

## Royal Canadian Air Force

##### Aerospace Engineering Officer

Did a bit of this over the summer, got to see how a CP-140 Aurora was worked on, travel up north, drop things off of an airplane into the ocean, and learned a ton

##### Royal Military College

Most of my time was spent at RMC getting my BEng in Computer Engineering.
