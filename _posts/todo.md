# Top items are most important

## Kara's jobs
1. Create a training set of images and learn how to run code to generate a cameraMatrixInit, check out [this website](https://mecaruco2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks_rst/Aruco/sandbox/ludovic/aruco_calibration_rotation.html) to see what I think we need to do.
2. Figure out what the datatype coming out of the /camera/depth_registered/whatever type nodes is, it says 'compressed image' but I believe it is actually some sort of XYZRGB system that could be used to figure out the distance to a particular pixel. Figure out how to scoop this info out of this node.
3. Print off and stick on hard backings a bunch of ArUco markers, hopefully the same size as the first set you printed, if not then measure them too. Put them up in the room in some sort of order that makes sense.
