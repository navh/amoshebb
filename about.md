Working in a super cool Data Science and Engineering lab in HSBC's Toronto office. Still learning the ropes of both data science and banking but confident that I'll be able to provide meaningful insights to the bank.

Computer Engineering graduate from Royal Military College, spending summers doing Aerospace Engineering introductory training, and military basic training.

Dipped my toes into first year science and then engineering at MUN before moving to Kingston for RMC. 

Before that was a Rotary Youth Exchange student in the Luxembourg region of Belgium where I tried to learn French but mostly learned to love chocolate, waffles, and beer.

Grew up on a small farm in beautiful Billtown, Nova Scotia where my interest in how everything works was cultivated among a ton of old farm machines and various contraptions that I built myself.

That's my background so far, can't wait to add more to it!
