Hello.

I am an Officer Cadet at the Royal Military College studying Computer Engineering. 

I hope that some day this website will be amazing, but for now, it is just a quick way for me to get online.

Check out updates to the project I'm trying to work on, hopefully it will be pretty nifty once it's done!
