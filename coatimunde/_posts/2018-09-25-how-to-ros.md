# How to ROS

## Another Laptop Warmed Up

The exciting new ThinkPad is finally loaded up with a fresh version of Ubuntu which is letting us install the [Melodic Morenia](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic) and hopefully shortly get a simulation fired up.

## Baby Laptop

The ASUS ended up getting formatted with the [TurtleBot pre-wrapped OS](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo/Turtlebot%20Installation) which worked pretty well, but isn't the version we intend to use as support runs out before our thesis is due.

We were able to quickly run through a bunch of the tutorials though and managed to get it to drive around using a keyboard.

## Simulator Land

Now that we have managed to make the robot work we are going to moth-ball it and focus on trying to get a simulator environment made up that includes our [OpenCV Shapes](https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html) and the turtlebot as well as a few things for it to bump in to and then focus on making that work!
