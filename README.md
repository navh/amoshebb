# Amos Hebb

This website is intended to be used as a blog about one of my projects I'm working on this year, as well as a fun way for me to park my name as a domain because I'm paranoid that there's one other Amos Hebb out there who might scoop it up.

### On an unlimited Jekyll host

and run `bundle install` to install the plugin.

Add this to your sites *_config.yml* file:

	theme: the-plain

Then copy some of the settings from this repo's *_config.yml* file to your own, and modify them.

## The Plain

> The theme I used is called "The Plain". It is a minimalist Jekyll theme, ideally designed for your personal blog use. This Jekyll theme provides a minimum distraction so you can focus on writing that matters to you and your readers. This theme is originally inspired from [Leonard Lamprecht's _leo_ theme](https://github.com/leo/leo.github.io).
